The goal of the R package `bsqts` is to provide some functions that Iâ€™ve
needed recurrently working on data science.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("pbousquets/bsqts")
```

Then you can attach the package `bsqts`:

``` r
library("bsqts")
```
