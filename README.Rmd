The goal of the R package `bsqts` is to provide some functions that I've needed recurrently working on data science.



## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("pbousquets/bsqts")
```

Then you can attach the package `bsqts`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library("bsqts")
```
